## About

This module allows to upgrade your shop to a more recent version of PrestaShop. It can used as a CLI tool or with a web assistant.
This module is compatible with all PrestaShop 1.7 versions.

# Branches

Branch `develop` contains code for future versions of the module, which allow upgrades from 1.7.x versions to higher.
Branch `4.14.x` contains code for `4.14.x` patch versions which allow upgrading from 1.6.x versions to 1.7.x .

If you wish to upgrade a shop powered by PrestaShop 1.6, please use the latest 4.14.x version to upgrade to a 1.7 version.
Upgrades from 1.6.x to 8.x should be done in 2 steps (1.6.x to 1.7.x then 1.7.x to 8.x).

Please note PrestaShop 1.6 and older are not maintained anymore.

# Prerequisites

* PrestaShop 1.7 or 8
* PHP 5.6+

# Installation

All versions can be found in the [releases list](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases).

## Create a module from source code

If you download a ZIP archive that contains the source code or if you want to use the current state of the code, you need to build the module from the sources:

* Clone (`git clone https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade.git`) or [download](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/archive/master.zip) the source code. You can also download a release **Source code** ([ex. v4.14.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/archive/v4.14.2.zip)). If you download a source code archive, you need to extract the file and rename the extracted folder to **autoupgrade**
* Enter into folder **autoupgrade** and run the command `composer install`  ([composer](https://getcomposer.org/)).
* Create a new ZIP archive from the of **autoupgrade** folder.
* Now you can install it in your shop. For example, you can upload it using the dropzone in Module Manager back office page. 

# Running an upgrade on PrestaShop

Upgrading a shop can be done using:

* the configuration page of the module (browse the back office page provided by the module)
* in command line by calling the file *cli-upgrade.php*

## Command line parameters

Upgrade can be automated by calling *cli-upgrade.php*.
The following parameters are mandatory:

* **--dir**: Tells where the admin directory is.
* **--channel**: Selects what upgrade to run (minor, major etc.)
* **--action**: Advanced users only. Sets the step you want to start from (Default: `UpgradeNow`, [other values available](classes/TaskRunner/Upgrade/)).

```
$ php cli-upgrade.php --dir=admin-dev --channel=major
```

# Rollback a shop

If an error occurs during the upgrade process, the rollback will be suggested.
In case you lost the page from your backoffice, note it can be triggered via CLI.

## Command line parameters

Rollback can be automated by calling *cli-rollback.php*.
The following parameters are mandatory:

* **--dir**: Tells where the admin directory is.
* **--backup**: Select the backup to restore (this can be found in your folder `<admin>/autoupgrade/backup/`)

```
$ php cli-rollback.php  --dir=admin-dev --backup=V1.7.5.1_20190502-191341-22e883bd
