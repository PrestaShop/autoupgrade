## About

This module allows to upgrade your shop to a more recent version of PrestaShop. It can used as a CLI tool or with a web assistant.
The latest versions of the module are compatible with all PrestaShop 1.7 and higher releases.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This module has a specific [Release Process][release-process]. If you do release a new version, make sure to follow it.

## Branches

Branch `develop` contains code for future versions of the module, which allow upgrades from 1.7.x versions to higher.

Branch `4.14.x` contains code for `4.14.x` patch versions which allow upgrading from 1.6.x versions to 1.7.x .

If you wish to upgrade a shop powered by PrestaShop 1.6, **please use the latest 4.14.3 version** to upgrade to a 1.7 version.
Upgrades from 1.6.x to 8.x should be done in 2 steps (1.6.x to 1.7.x then 1.7.x to 8.x).

Please note PrestaShop 1.6 and older are not maintained anymore.

## Prerequisites

* PrestaShop 1.7 or 8
* PHP >= 7.1
* Node.js >= 20 - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preference for LTS 20.11.0)

## Installation

All versions can be found in the [releases list](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases).

### Create a module from source code

If you download a ZIP archive that contains the source code or if you want to use the current state of the code, you need to build the module from the sources:

* Clone (`git clone https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade.git`) or [download](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/archive/master.zip) the source code. You can also download a release **Source code** ([ex. v4.14.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/archive/v4.14.2.zip)). If you download a source code archive, you need to extract the file and rename the extracted folder to **autoupgrade**
* Enter into folder **autoupgrade** and run the command `composer install`  ([composer](https://getcomposer.org/)).
* Enter into folder **autoupgrade/_dev** and run the commands `npm install` and `npm run build:vite` ([npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)).
* Create a new ZIP archive from the of **autoupgrade** folder.
* Now you can install it in your shop. For example, you can upload it using the dropzone in Module Manager back office page. 

## Running an upgrade on PrestaShop

Upgrading a shop can be done using:

* the configuration page of the module (browse the back office page provided by the module)
* in command line by calling `bin/console`

### Command line parameters

This module provide a powerful command-line interface based on Symfony Console, allowing you to execute various commands
to manage your store. You can use this interface to perform updates, rollbacks, and check system requirements.

To use the Symfony Console, simply run the following command from the root directory of autoupgrade module:

```
$ php bin/console
```

For instance, to start upgrading your store, you would use:

```
$ php bin/console update:start --config-file-path=[/path/to/config.json] --chain <your-admin-dir>
```

You can see all available parameters and options directly from the console by using the `--help` option with any command.

For more information on using commands, please refer to the [PrestaShop developer documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/basics/keeping-up-to-date/upgrade-module/upgrade-cli/)

### Configuration file

For the proper functioning of the update process via the console, it is necessary to provide a configuration file in JSON format.

Here is an example of the different fields that can be found in it:

```json
{
  "channel": "archive", // see https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/basics/keeping-up-to-date/upgrade-module/channels/
  "archive_prestashop": "prestashop_8.0.0.zip", // Name of the zip file, specific to the archive channel, to be placed in the [your-admin-dir]/autoupgrade/download folder
  "archive_xml": "prestashop_8.0.0.xml", // Name of the XML file, specific to the archive channel, to be placed in the [your-admin-dir]/autoupgrade/download folder
  "archive_num": "8.0.0", // Release number, specific to the archive channel
  "PS_AUTOUP_CUSTOM_MOD_DESACT": 1, // Disable non-native modules
  "PS_AUTOUP_CHANGE_DEFAULT_THEME": 0, // Keep the current theme
  "PS_AUTOUP_KEEP_MAILS": 0, // Retain customized email templates
  "PS_AUTOUP_BACKUP": 0, // Do not create a store backup
  "PS_AUTOUP_KEEP_IMAGES": 1, // Retain images
  "PS_DISABLE_OVERRIDES": 1 // Disable all overrides
}
```

## Rollback a shop

If an error occurs during the upgrade process, the rollback will be suggested.
In case you lost the page from your backoffice, note it can be triggered via CLI.

### Command line parameters

For restore your store, you would use:

```
$ php bin/console backup:restore --backup=[backup-name]  <your-admin-dir>
```

You can see all available parameters and options directly from the console by using the `--help` option with any command.
